# Table catalog and data sources

`readAOFM` ships a local catalogue that maps AOFM Data Hub workbooks to
search terms, public selectors, parser families, and direct HTTPS source
routes. This article records the 23 parser-supported entries and the
seven raw-only / unsupported entries available through raw workbook
download. Reader calls retrieve current source workbooks; the catalogue
itself supplies stable, offline discovery metadata.

## The 23 parsed tables

The public selectors are exact. The table below is deliberately explicit
so that the table ID, family, and corresponding
[`read_aofm()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/read_aofm.md)
call are visible in one place. The validation column is computed with
[`search_aofm()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/search_aofm.md),
which is an offline catalogue operation.

The same catalogue can be searched with user-facing terms. These calls
are local and return metadata only because `read = FALSE` is the
default:

``` r

## Raw-only workbook catalogue entries

The following seven catalogue IDs are available through the raw workbook
download path while the parser-supported workflow focuses on the 23
entries above. They remain explicit catalogue rows with
`supported = FALSE`, not additional parser families:

``` r

raw_only_ids <- c(
  "tb_issuance_conversion",
  "indexation_factors",
  "rmbs_transactions",
  "rmbs_auctions",
  "interest_rate_swaps",
  "cross_currency_swaps",
  "portfolio_overview"
)

raw_only <- data.frame(
  id = raw_only_ids,
  parser = NA_character_,
  access = "download_aofm_xlsx()",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# This check reads package metadata only. It does not download a workbook;
# users should use search_aofm() rather than this internal object.
catalog_metadata <- get("aofm_index", envir = asNamespace("readAOFM"))
stopifnot(
  setequal(raw_only_ids, catalog_metadata$id[catalog_metadata$fn == "no function exists"]),
  all(catalog_metadata$fn[catalog_metadata$id %in% raw_only_ids] == "no function exists")
)
raw_only
#>                       id parser               access
#> 1 tb_issuance_conversion   <NA> download_aofm_xlsx()

```

The raw-only source filenames remain extension-compatible with their
direct routes, including the legacy `.xls` files. `portfolio_overview`
is a verified historical direct workbook that is not currently listed on
the Data Hub; it is retained as raw-only and is not presented as current
or parser-supported.

[`download_aofm_xlsx()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/download_aofm_xlsx.md)
is the public raw-workbook helper. Its selectors are the `security` and
`type` values shown for parsed rows. The raw-only rows have no parser
and no public
[`read_aofm()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/read_aofm.md)
call; because their selector fields are not populated, an unfiltered raw
download is the available public route and will also select other
catalogue workbooks. The function writes files beneath `data/` in the
working directory and performs a live HTTPS request, so this article
does not run it automatically.

## Source access and scope

The public AOFM Data Hub provides these workbooks without a package
username, password, or API key.
[`search_aofm()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/search_aofm.md)
performs local discovery. Reader and raw download calls request the
workbook URL recorded in the package catalogue over HTTPS, stage it in a
temporary file (readers), or save it beneath `data/` (raw downloads).
Each call retrieves the current source rather than using a persistent
package cache. The opt-in
[`download_aofm_file()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/download_aofm_file.md)
API instead keeps a verified, content-addressed workbook and metadata
beneath the caller-selected `.readAOFM/data/<table-id>/` root;
[`aofm_file_metadata()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/aofm_file_metadata.md)
and
[`read_aofm_file()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/read_aofm_file.md)
inspect and parse local files without network access.

Readers and raw downloads accept `timeout`, `retries`, and `max_bytes`
controls (30 seconds, one retry, and 100 MiB by default). Managed
downloads additionally bound cache age, file count, total bytes, and
lock wait time. These controls keep network and filesystem work explicit
and finite for scripts, tests, and CRAN builds.

AOFM controls workbook URLs, sheet names, columns, and historical
coverage. Turnover observation periods and publication cadence are
separate: current turnover workbooks contain monthly observations, the
Data Hub update is quarterly with an approximately two-month lag,
historical **By Tenor** is monthly, and historical **By Category** is
quarterly. The historical turnover companions end in December 2025 and
the redesigned current workbooks begin in January 2026.
[`read_secondary()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/read_secondary.md)
joins them by `period`, `group`, and `name`, uses current rows for
overlaps, rejects duplicate keys, and attaches the two source records as
`aofm_sources`. The groups are `tenor`, `investor_type`, `security`,
`region`, and `counterparty`.

The continuity CSV retains `legacy_max = 2024-12-31` as the boundary of
the pinned retired-baseline comparison. The replacement historical
workbook extends through `2025-12-31`; together with the current
`2026-01-31` onward workbook it provides the documented no-gap
transition. The packaged workbook snapshots used by tests and vignettes
are deterministic examples, not a replacement for the live AOFM source
or a runtime cache. A changed URL, HTML error page, unavailable source,
or changed workbook layout can therefore make a read fail; report the
table ID, selector, error text, and access date.
