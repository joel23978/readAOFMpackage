# Read a transactional AOFM workbook

`read_transactional()` handles tender, buyback, retail-facility, and
securities-lending workbooks. It downloads the selected workbook over
HTTPS without credentials, stages it in a temporary file, and pivots
numeric measures into long form. The package has no persistent cache and
applies the package-wide bounded timeout and size safeguards described
in
[`read_aofm()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/read_aofm.md).

## Usage

``` r
read_transactional(aofm_table, csv = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- aofm_table:

  One of `tb_issuance`, `tb_buyback`, `tib_issuance`, `tib_buyback`,
  `tn_issuance`, `retail`, or `slf`. It is normally selected through
  [`read_aofm()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/read_aofm.md).

- csv:

  Logical scalar (default `FALSE`). If `TRUE`, write the parsed result
  to `output/<aofm_table>.csv` beneath the current working directory.

## Value

A tibble/data frame in long form. Workbook identifier columns are
retained; numeric measures are represented by `name` and `value`. Known
date fields such as `date_held`, `date_settled`, `maturity`,
`settle_date`, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `security_maturity_date`
are normalised to `Date` where present. Exact measures and identifier
columns follow the current source workbook.

## Details

Empty files, missing required columns, non-workbook responses, and
changed AOFM layouts cause an error. Missing measure values are omitted
by the parser.
