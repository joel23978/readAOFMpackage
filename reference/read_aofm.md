# Read and tidy one or more AOFM Data Hub tables

`read_aofm()` is the preferred high-level interface to readAOFM. It maps
the optional `security` and `type` filters to the package's supported
AOFM table catalogue, downloads each selected workbook over HTTPS, and
dispatches to the appropriate family reader. The package does not
require credentials and the reader stages each workbook in a temporary
file rather than maintaining a managed cache. Use `timeout`, `retries`,
and `max_bytes` to bound live transfers. For a caller-selected
content-addressed cache, use
[`download_aofm_file()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/download_aofm_file.md)
and then parse the retained workbook with
[`read_aofm_file()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/read_aofm_file.md).

## Usage

``` r
read_aofm(
  security = NULL,
  type = NULL,
  csv = FALSE,
  timeout = getOption("readAOFM.timeout", 30),
  retries = getOption("readAOFM.retries", 1L),
  max_bytes = getOption("readAOFM.max_bytes", 100 * 1024^2)
)
```

## Arguments

- security:

  Optional exact security family (default `NULL`). Supported values are
  `summary`, `aggregate`, `tb`, `tib`, `tn`, `slf`, `ownership`,
  `retail`, and `termpremium`. If omitted, all supported families are
  considered.

- type:

  Optional exact table type (default `NULL`). Supported values are
  `dealt`, `settlement`, `issuance`, `syndication`, `buyback`,
  `turnover`, `public`, and `nonresident`. If omitted, all supported
  types for `security` are considered.

- csv:

  Logical scalar (default `FALSE`). If `TRUE`, pass the option to each
  family reader; parsed output is also written beneath `output/` in the
  current working directory. For a list result, one CSV is written per
  component.

- timeout:

  Positive finite numeric scalar giving the per-attempt workbook
  transport timeout in seconds (default
  `getOption("readAOFM.timeout", 30)`; maximum 300 seconds).

- retries:

  Non-negative integer scalar giving the number of retries after the
  first workbook transport attempt (default
  `getOption("readAOFM.retries", 1L)`; maximum 5).

- max_bytes:

  Positive finite numeric scalar giving the maximum accepted workbook
  size in bytes (default
  `getOption("readAOFM.max_bytes", 100 * 1024^2)`; maximum 1 GiB).

## Value

If the filters identify one table, the corresponding reader result:
usually a long-form tibble/data frame with identifier columns, `date` or
`period`, `name`, and `value`, or a named list of such data frames for
multi-sheet workbook families. If the filters identify multiple tables,
returns a named list keyed by stable table ID. With no filters, the list
has one element for each of the 23 parser-supported tables.

Transactional and syndication results preserve workbook identifier
fields and pivot measures to `name`/`value`; parsed dates are `Date`
objects where the source provides dates. Syndication `value` is numeric.
End-of-month results contain one named component per non-Notes worksheet
(the current Treasury Bond/Treasury Indexed Bond workbooks include
`FaceValue`, `MarketValue`, `Delta`, `Duration`, and `Tenor`; source
layouts may vary). For Treasury Bond, Treasury Indexed Bond, and
Treasury Note end-of-month outputs, each component also carries a
`Series` identifier for repeated security identities. Ownership readers
return named lists of component data frames. Exact measure columns
follow the current AOFM workbook and may change if AOFM changes its
source layout. Turnover results join the historical and redesigned
current workbooks on `period`, `group`, and `name`, and include an
`aofm_sources` attribute with named `historical` and `current` records
containing source URLs, roles, table IDs, filenames, byte counts, UTC
retrieval times, and SHA-256 hashes. Historical turnover covers July
2016 through December 2025: `By Tenor` observations are monthly and
`By Category` observations are quarterly. Redesigned `Security`,
`Region`, and `Counterparty` sheets begin with monthly January 2026
observations. AOFM publishes updates quarterly with a two-month lag.
Current rows take precedence for an overlapping natural key, and
duplicate `period`/`group`/`name` identities are rejected.

## Details

The transport controls default to 30 seconds per attempt, one retry, and
100 MiB through `getOption("readAOFM.timeout")`,
`getOption("readAOFM.retries")`, and `getOption("readAOFM.max_bytes")`.
They must be finite scalar values with `0 < timeout <= 300`, integer
`0 <= retries <= 5`, and `0 < max_bytes <= 1 GiB`.

Supported table IDs cover end-of-financial-year positions, end-of-month
positions, Treasury Bond, Treasury Indexed Bond and Treasury Note
transactions, syndications, buybacks, retail and securities-lending
data, public and non-resident ownership, secondary-market turnover, and
term premium estimates. The full catalogue also contains seven raw-only
(unsupported) rows without parsers; those rows are excluded here. Use
[`aofm_catalog()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/aofm_catalog.md)
with `include_unsupported = TRUE` to inspect all 30 routes and
[`download_aofm_xlsx()`](https://joel23978.github.io/readAOFM/reference/download_aofm_xlsx.md)
for an unfiltered raw download of the full catalogue.

A selection that matches no supported table throws an error. Transport
failures, non-workbook responses, empty files, missing sheets, missing
required columns, and incompatible upstream layouts also throw errors.
The `csv = TRUE` side effect writes parsed data under `output/` in the
current working directory. The AOFM source is external, so examples and
tests should use local fixtures or mocks when deterministic, offline
execution is required.
