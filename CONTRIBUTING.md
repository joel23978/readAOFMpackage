# Contributing to readAOFM

Contributions that improve reproducibility, documentation, or compatibility
with the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) Data Hub are
welcome. Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joel23978/readAOFM/issues)
for discussion before substantial changes.

## Issues

For a bug or changed workbook layout, include the readAOFM version or commit,
R version, operating system, table selector, access date, a minimal
reproducible example, and the expected and actual result. Remove credentials,
tokens, private data, and unnecessary downloaded workbooks before posting.
Use the security guidance in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for sensitive reports.

## Pull requests

Keep changes focused and preserve the public function signatures, return
contracts, source attribution, and offline testability. Add or update tests
and user documentation when behaviour or supported source layouts change.
Do not commit downloaded AOFM workbooks, generated check/tarball/site output,
or credentials. A useful local baseline is:

```sh
R CMD check .
```

If a change depends on a live AOFM response, include a deterministic fixture
or mock for the test path and explain the source URL and licensing terms.
Pull requests should describe compatibility considerations and any check
results that were actually run.
