#' Read AOFM Data Hub workbooks in R
#'
#' readAOFM provides a reproducible, table-oriented interface to workbooks
#' published by the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM). Users can
#' discover supported tables with [search_aofm()], retrieve and parse one or
#' more tables with [read_aofm()], use a family-specific reader when needed, or
#' save raw workbooks with [download_aofm_xlsx()]. The opt-in managed workflow
#' [download_aofm_file()] verifies and retains one workbook in a bounded,
#' content-addressed cache; [read_aofm_file()] parses a retained local file
#' without another network request. Parsed results are returned in long-form
#' data frames or named lists of data frames, depending on the workbook family.
#'
#' Public AOFM workbooks are available without package credentials. Reads and
#' raw downloads use HTTPS. The legacy readers stage workbooks in temporary
#' files and retrieve the current source on each call. Parsed CSV output is an
#' explicit opt-in side effect under `output/`; legacy raw workbook downloads
#' are an explicit operation under `data/` in the current working directory.
#' The managed API instead stores SHA-256-named workbooks, metadata, and locks
#' under caller-selected `.readAOFM/data/<table_id>/` and prunes entries using
#' explicit age/count/byte bounds. It never writes to a package installation;
#' callers choose whether a cache root is temporary or persistent.
#'
#' AOFM secondary-market turnover uses separate historical and redesigned
#' current workbooks. [read_secondary()] joins both official sources into a
#' continuous result across the December 2025/January 2026 boundary, retains
#' their source-specific monthly/quarterly observation granularity, and records
#' both workbook hashes in provenance. AOFM publishes current updates quarterly
#' with a two-month lag.
